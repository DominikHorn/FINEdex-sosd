# FINEdex-SOSD
The code in this repo is an adapted version of the original code published as
part of the following paper:

```
Pengfei Li, Yu Hua, Jingnan Jia, Pengfei Zuo, “FINEdex: A Fine-grained Learned
Index Scheme for Scalable and Concurrent Memory Systems”, Proceedings of the
48th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB), 2022.
```

It has been modified to act as standalone header-only dependency usable via
standard CMake dependency management facilities.
